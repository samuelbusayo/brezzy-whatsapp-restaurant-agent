- [x] `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration for client-side routing
- [x] `api/webhook.ts` - Serverless webhook handler
- [x] `@vercel/node` - TypeScript types installed

### 2. 🔐 Get Your Supabase Credentials
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click on **Settings** → **API**
3. Copy these values:
   - **Project URL** (e.g., `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - **anon/public key** (starts with `eyJ...`)

## Vercel Setup Steps

### Step 1: Configure Build Settings

In your Vercel project dashboard, set:

```
Root Directory:     .     (or leave blank)
Framework Preset:   Vite
Build Command:      npm run build
Output Directory:   dist
Install Command:    npm install
```

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables

Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables** and add:

**Variable 1:**
```
Name:  VITE_SUPABASE_URL
Value: your_supabase_project_url
```

**Variable 2:**
```
Name:  VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
Value: your_supabase_anon_key
```

⚠️ **Make sure to add these to ALL environments:**
- [x] Production
- [x] Preview  
- [x] Development

### Step 3: Deploy
Click the **Deploy** button in Vercel!

## After Deployment

### 1. Get Your Webhook URL
Your webhook endpoint will be:
```
https://your-app-name.vercel.app/api/webhook
```

### 2. Test the Webhook
Use this curl command (replace with your actual URL):

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app-name.vercel.app/api/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "test", "message": "Testing webhook"}'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Webhook received and processed",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-23T..."
}
```

### 3. Update Your Webhook Provider
If you're using WhatsApp Business API, Twilio, or any messaging platform:
- Update the webhook URL to point to: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app/api/webhook`

## ✨ How Real-time Works Now

Your app **already uses Supabase Realtime**, so you'll get instant notifications:

1. **Webhook arrives** → Vercel serverless function receives it
2. **Function processes** → Updates your Supabase database  
3. **Supabase Realtime** → Automatically pushes changes to your frontend
4. **Frontend updates** → Notifications appear instantly! 🔔

**No WebSockets needed! Everything is serverless!** 🎉

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Build fails with "Environment variable not found"
**Fix:** Make sure you added the environment variables in Vercel settings (not just in your local `.env` file)

### Issue: 404 errors on page refresh
**Fix:** The `vercel.json` file handles this. Make sure it exists and was committed to Git.

### Issue: "Failed to connect to Supabase"
**Fix:** 
1. Check that environment variables are set correctly in Vercel
2. Make sure you selected **all environments** when adding them
3. Redeploy after adding environment variables

### Issue: Notifications not appearing
**Fix:**
1. Open browser console and check for errors
2. Verify Supabase Realtime is enabled in your Supabase project
3. Check Supabase table permissions (RLS policies)
