# Notification System & Delivered Orders Update

## 🎯 Summary of Changes

Two major improvements have been implemented:

1. **Enhanced New Order Notifications** - Interactive notifications with "View Details" button
2. **Accurate Delivered Orders Tracking** - Now counts only orders with actual delivery timestamps

---

## 📬 1. Enhanced New Order Notifications

### What Changed

When a new order is created in the database, the system now displays:

**Toast Notification:**
```
You have a new order!
Status: pending
[View Details] button
```

**Notification History Entry:**
```
New order #ORD-123 (Status: pending)
[View] button
```

### Features

✅ **Custom Toast Message** - Shows order status (e.g., "pending")  
✅ **Interactive Button** - "View Details" button in toast notification  
✅ **Direct Order Access** - Clicking the button opens the order details modal  
✅ **Persistent History** - All notifications saved in dropdown with "View" buttons  
✅ **Automatic Modal Opening** - Order details modal opens instantly when button clicked  

### User Experience Flow

1. **New Order Created** → Database INSERT event triggered
2. **Toast Appears** → Shows "You have a new order!" with status
3. **User Clicks "View Details"** → Fetches order from database
4. **Modal Opens** → Shows complete order information
5. **Notification Saved** → Added to history dropdown with timestamp
6. **History Access** → User can click "View" button anytime to reopen order

## 🚚 2. Delivered Orders Tracking

### What Changed

The "Delivered Orders" statistic now accurately counts only orders that have been delivered with a confirmed timestamp.

**Before:**
```typescript
deliveredOrders = allOrders.filter((o) => o.status === 'delivered').length;
```
❌ Counted orders with status "delivered" even without delivery timestamp

**After:**
```typescript
deliveredOrders = allOrders.filter((o) => o.delivered_at !== null).length;
```
✅ Counts only orders with actual delivery timestamp

### Why This Matters

- **Accurate Metrics** - Only orders with confirmed delivery times are counted
- **Data Integrity** - Prevents counting orders marked as "delivered" without timestamp
- **Better Tracking** - Ensures delivered_at field is properly populated
